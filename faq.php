            1. What type of school is Mount Pleasant Academy (MPA)?

          </h4>
          <p>
            MPA is a private, alternative school for children with psychiatric, emotional, or behavioral challenges, including children functioning along the Autism Spectrum. We also provide services for children with learning disabilities, although that is usually not the primary reason for referral to MPA.

            2. How are students referred to MPA?
          </h4>
          <p>
                      Most times, public school special education departments will refer a student to us if the school department is no longer able to meet the child’s needs within the school district. A parent must agree to the child being referred to MPA.
          Families are also welcome to refer their children for consideration for admission to MPA. In that case, the child’s family would be responsible for tuition, not the school district.<br></br>
          After we receive a referral packet, we’ll contact the family, invite them to tour the facility, usually invite the prospective student to have lunch with his potential classmates, and then contact the LEA as to whether we think that the student is an appropriate candidate for admission.

            3. How long does it take for a student to be admitted?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Depending on when we get the referral packet, and how quickly the parent can come in for a tour, we can usually admit within one week of receipt of the referral information. We routinely have a waiting list for placement, which may delay admission. Our capacity is 34-36 students.

          5. Who pays for the child’s tuition?

          </h4>
          <p>
            Tuition is paid by the referring school district. If a family refers its own child, then the family is responsible for tuition.
