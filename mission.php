            Since 2001, Mount Pleasant Academy 
            (MPA) has established itself as a premiere facility 
            for children who need extra support for their 
            educational and emotional development.
            Mount Pleasant Academy provides 
            cutting-edge education and therapeutic services 
            for its children and their families. By combining 
            current research findings, state-of-the-art teaching 
            and multisensory strategies, and a fully-integrated 
            team of educators, occupational therapists, 
            speech/language therapists, childrenâ€™s mental 
            health specialists, and family support workers, we 
            can provide children at MPA comprehensive 
            services that surpass those available in a public 
            school setting.
